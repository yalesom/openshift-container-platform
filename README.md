## READ the instructions in its entirety before deploying!

Additional documentation for deploying OpenShift in Azure can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/openshift-get-started

This template deploys multiple VMs and requires some pre-work before you can successfully deploy the OpenShift Cluster.  If you don't get the pre-work done correctly, you will most likely fail to deploy the cluster using this template.  Please read the instructions completely before you proceed. 

This template uses the On-Demand Red Hat Enterprise Linux image from the Azure Gallery. 
>When using the On-Demand image, there is an hourly charge for using this image.  At the same time, the instance will be registered to your Red Hat subscription, so you will also be using one of your entitlements. This will lead to "double billing".

After successful deployment, the Bastion Node is no longer required unless you want to use it to add nodes or run other playbooks in the future.  The Bastion node is the only node by default that has the private key for SSH to all the cluster nodes. You can turn it off and delete it or keep it around for running future playbooks.  You can also use this as the jump host for managing your OpenShift cluster.

## Prerequisites

### Generate SSH Keys

You'll need to generate an SSH key pair (Public / Private) in order to provision this template. Ensure that you do **NOT** include a passphrase with the private key. <br/><br/>
If you are using a Windows computer, you can download puttygen.exe.  You will need to export to OpenSSH (from Conversions menu) to get a valid Private Key for use in the Template.<br/><br/>
From a Linux or Mac, you can just use the ssh-keygen command.  Once you are finished deploying the cluster, you can always generate new keys that uses a passphrase and replace the original ones used during initial deployment.

### Create Key Vault to store SSH Private Key

You will need to create a Key Vault to store your SSH Private Key that will then be used as part of the deployment.  This extra work is to provide security around the Private Key - especially since it does not have a passphrase.  I recommend creating a Resource Group specifically to store the KeyVault.  This way, you can reuse the KeyVault for other deployments and you won't have to create this every time you chose to deploy another OpenShift cluster.

**Create Key Vault using Azure CLI 2.0**<br/>
1.  Create new Resource Group: az group create -n \<name\> -l \<location\><br/>
    Ex: `az group create -n ResourceGroupName -l 'East US'`<br/>
1.  Create Key Vault: az keyvault create -n \<vault-name\> -g \<resource-group\> -l \<location\> --enabled-for-template-deployment true<br/>
    Ex: `az keyvault create -n KeyVaultName -g ResourceGroupName -l 'East US' --enabled-for-template-deployment true`<br/>
1.  Create Secret: az keyvault secret set --vault-name \<vault-name\> -n \<secret-name\> --file \<private-key-file-name\><br/>
    Ex: `az keyvault secret set --vault-name KeyVaultName -n SecretName --file ~/.ssh/id_rsa`<br/>

### Generate Azure Active Directory (AAD) Service Principal

To configure Azure as the Cloud Provider for OpenShift Container Platform, you will need to create an Azure Active Directory Service Principal.  The easiest way to perform this task is via the Azure CLI.  Below are the steps for doing this.

Assigning permissions to the entire Subscription is the easiest method but does give the Service Principal permissions to all resources in the Subscription.  Assigning permissions to only the Resource Group is the most secure as the Service Principal is restricted to only that one Resource Group. 
   
**Azure CLI 2.0**

1. **Create Service Principal and assign permissions to Subscription**<br/>
  a.  az ad sp create-for-rbac -n \<friendly name\> --password \<password\> --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/\<subscription_id\><br/>
      Ex: `az ad sp create-for-rbac -n openshiftcloudprovider --password Pass@word1 --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/555a123b-1234-5ccc-defgh-6789abcdef01`<br/>

2. **Create Service Principal and assign permissions to Resource Group**<br/>
  a.  If you use this option, you must have created the Resource Group first.  Be sure you don't create any resources in this Resource Group before deploying the cluster.<br/>
  b.  az ad sp create-for-rbac -n \<friendly name\> --password \<password\> --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/\<subscription_id\>/resourceGroups/\<Resource Group Name\><br/>
      Ex: `az ad sp create-for-rbac -n openshiftcloudprovider --password Pass@word1 --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/555a123b-1234-5ccc-defgh-6789abcdef01/resourceGroups/00000test`<br/>

3. **Create Service Principal without assigning permissions to Resource Group**<br/>
  a.  If you use this option, you will need to assign permissions to either the Subscription or the newly created Resource Group shortly after you initiate the deployment of the cluster or the post installation scripts will fail when configuring Azure as the Cloud Provider.<br/>
  b.  az ad sp create-for-rbac -n \<friendly name\> --password \<password\> --role contributor --skip-assignment<br/>
      Ex: `az ad sp create-for-rbac -n openshiftcloudprovider --password Pass@word1 --role contributor --skip-assignment`<br/>

You will get an output similar to:

```javascript
{
  "appId": "2c8c6a58-44ac-452e-95d8-a790f6ade583",
  "displayName": "openshiftcloudprovider",
  "name": "http://openshiftcloudprovider",
  "password": "Pass@word1",
  "tenant": "12a345bc-1234-dddd-12ab-34cdef56ab78"
}
```

The appId is used for the aadClientId parameter.


### Red Hat Subscription Access

For security reasons, the method for registering the RHEL system allows the use of an Organization ID and Activation Key as well as a Username and Password. Please know that it is more secure to use the Organization ID and Activation Key.

You can determine your Organization ID by running ```subscription-manager identity``` on a registered machine.  To create or find your Activation Key, please go here: https://access.redhat.com/management/activation_keys.

You will also need to get the Pool ID that contains your entitlements for OpenShift.  You can retrieve this from the Red Hat portal by examining the details of the subscription that has the OpenShift entitlements.  Or you can contact your Red Hat administrator to help you.

## Deploy Template

Deploy to Azure using Azure Portal: 
<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2Fopenshift-container-platform%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/></a>
<a href="https://portal.azure.us/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2Fopenshift-container-platform%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/AzureGov.png"/></a>
<a href="http://armviz.io/#/?load=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2Fopenshift-container-platform%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://armviz.io/visualizebutton.png"/></a>
<br/>

Once you have collected all of the prerequisites for the template, you can deploy the template by clicking Deploy to Azure or populating the **azuredeploy.parameters.json** file and executing Resource Manager deployment commands with PowerShell or the Azure CLI.

**Azure CLI 2.0**

1. Create Resource Group: az group create -n \<name\> -l \<location\><br />
Ex: `az group create -n openshift-cluster -l westus`
2. Create Resource Group Deployment: az group deployment create --name \<deployment name\> --template-file \<template_file\> --parameters @\<parameters_file\> --resource-group \<resource group name\> --nowait<br />
Ex: `az group deployment create --name ocpdeployment --template-file azuredeploy.json --parameters @azuredeploy.parameters.json --resource-group openshift-cluster --no-wait`


### NOTE

The OpenShift Ansible playbook does take a while to run when using VMs backed by Standard Storage. VMs backed by Premium Storage are faster. If you want Premium Storage, select a DS, Es, or GS series VM.  It is highly recommended that Premium storage be used.
<hr />

If the Azure Cloud Provider is not enabled, then the Service Catalog and Ansible Template Service Broker will not be installed as Service Catalog requires persistent storage.

Be sure to follow the OpenShift instructions to create the necessary DNS entry for the OpenShift Router for access to applications. <br />

A Standard Storage Account is provisioned to provide persistent storage for the integrated OpenShift Registry as Premium Storage does not support storage of anything but VHD files.


### TROUBLESHOOTING

If you encounter an error during deployment of the cluster, please view the deployment status.  The following Error Codes will help to narrow things down.

1.  Exit Code 3:  Your Red Hat Subscription User Name / Password or Organization ID / Activation Key is incorrect
2.  Exit Code 4:  Your Red Hat Pool ID is incorrect or there are no entitlements available
3.  Exit Code 5:  Unable to provision Docker Thin Pool Volume
4.  Exit Code 6:  OpenShift Cluster installation failed
5.  Exit Code 7:  OpenShift Cluster installation succeeded but Azure Cloud Provider configuration failed - master config on Master Node issue
6.  Exit Code 8:  OpenShift Cluster installation succeeded but Azure Cloud Provider configuration failed - node config on Master Node issue
7.  Exit Code 9:  OpenShift Cluster installation succeeded but Azure Cloud Provider configuration failed - node config on Infra or App Node issue
8.  Exit Code 10: OpenShift Cluster installation succeeded but Azure Cloud Provider configuration failed - correcting Master Nodes or not able to set Master as unschedulable
9.  Exit Code 11: Metrics failed to deploy
10. Exit Code 12: Logging failed to deploy

For Exit Codes 7 - 10, the OpenShift Cluster did install but the Azure Cloud Provider configuration failed.  You can SSH to the Bastion node and from there SSH to each of the nodes in the cluster and fix the issues.

A common cause for the failures with Exit Codes 7 - 9 is the Service Principal did not have proper permissions to the Subscription or the Resource Group.  If this is indeed the issue, then assign the correct permissions and manually re-run the script that failed an all subsequent scripts.  Be sure to restart the service that failed (e.g. systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node.service) before executing the scripts again.


For further troubleshooting, please SSH into your Bastion node on port 22.  You will need to be root **(sudo su -)** and then navigate to the following directory: **/var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download**<br/><br/>
You should see a folder named '0' and '1'.  In each of these folders, you will see two files, stderr and stdout.  You can look through these files to determine where the failure occurred.

## Post-Deployment Operations

### Service Catalog

**Service Catalog**

If you enable Azure or CNS for storage these scripts will deploy the service catalog as a post deployment option.

### Metrics and logging

**Metrics**

If you deployed Metrics, it will take a few extra minutes deployment to complete. Please be patient.

Once the deployment is complete, log into the OpenShift Web Console and complete an addition configuration step.  Go to the openshift-infra project, click on Hawkster metrics route, and accept the SSL exception in your browser.

**Logging**

If you deployed Logging, it will take a few extra minutes deployment to complete. Please be patient.

Once the deployment is complete, log into the OpenShift Web Console and complete an addition configuration step.  Go to the logging project, click on the Kubana route, and accept the SSL exception in your browser.

### Creation of additional users

To create additional (non-admin) users in your environment, login to your master server(s) via SSH and run:
<br><i>htpasswd /etc/origin/master/htpasswd mynewuser</i>

### Additional OpenShift Configuration Options
 
You can configure additional settings per the official (<a href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/welcome/index.html" target="_blank">OpenShift Enterprise Documentation</a>).
